cabal-version:      3.0
name:               base-prelude
version:            1.6.1
synopsis:           Featureful preludes formed solely from the "base" package
description:
  A library which aims to reexport all the non-conflicting and
  most general definitions from the \"base\" package.
  This includes APIs for applicatives, arrows, monoids, foldables, traversables,
  exceptions, generics, ST, MVars and STM.
  This package will never have any dependencies other than \"base\".
  Besides a rich prelude it provides limited ones like "BasePrelude.DataTypes",
  which only exports the data-types defined across the \"base\" package,
  and "BasePrelude.Operators", which only exports the common operators.
  /Versioning policy/
  The versioning policy of this package deviates from PVP in the sense
  that its exports in part are transitively determined by the version of \"base\".
  Therefore it's recommended for the users of \"base-prelude\" to specify
  the bounds of \"base\" as well.
